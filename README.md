# Page Server

## Description

This Page Server is a simple server that works in pages.

## Note

This requires Node.js 22 or newer.
Unless this gets rewrote into esm... which I don't feel like doing it.
(!): Experimental!! This will be changed eventually so that there isn't an experimental warning.
(You'll be able to toggle chalk in the future, and with this toggle, this'll let older versions work as well.)
